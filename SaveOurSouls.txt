The exact number nuclear weapons ammunition currently worldвЂ™s arsenals precisely known . Well-known , perhaps , one figure . The total capacity nuclear weapons stands 5,000 megatons - 1 ton per person Earth . `` Nuclear suitcases '' would attract much attention threat would fall hands terrorists . And likelihood development discounted . So , mechanism underground production terrible weapon twentieth century ? What options acquisition ? And today boast possessing nuclear weapon ? How make bomb ? Although nuclear weapons enemyвЂ™s вЂњdeterrenceвЂќ mechanism , hardly anyone would risk , today 's rules game international arena follows : want influence major league , time make clear вЂњsomeвЂќ For countries itвЂ™s better mess , need nuclear weapons . There three main ways get . The way `` Just ! '' . The common opinion experts make nuclear bomb easier many people think . Making bomb even easier stealing finished bomb . For manufacture nuclear explosive device , need material gives explosive splitting atoms , plus experts , equipment means delivery . So , material - nuclear device also built materials directly intended ( disturb `` atomic experts '' always ready leave test ) - highly enriched uranium metallic form . Delivering device target , many calculations , simplest task . Experts make fun mythologized вЂњbriefcase bomb , вЂќ seriously speak вЂњbomb large cargo containerвЂќ ( so-called вЂњhorse-bombвЂќ , name standard steel cargo containers goods imported USA ) . In practice , less 2 % containers open inspection containers pass x-ray detectors . So chances bring suitcase high . The former chief US nuclear arsenals , Eugene Habiger , states `` United States far unable defend . '' According , quite possible deliver nuclear device Philadelphia , New York , San Francisco , Los Angeles kill tens thousands people . Apparently , therefore , Habiger lives San Antonio , far river transport routes . In order become `` expert '' difficult task producing bomb , look library pretty much climb world wide web . The basic methods manufacturing atomic bomb known 50 years recipes described detail numerous works physics . The simplest way take small part enriched uranium , size small melon shoot inside barrel large cannon another uranium `` melon '' . Theodore Taylor , nuclear physicist creator largest smallest American nuclear warheads , staunch opponent nuclear devices , notes attentive reader find enough information nuclear bomb publicly available encyclopedia - even dimensions working specifications . However , creation bomb risky gamble . David Albright , worked UN weapons inspector Iraq , notes Saddam HusseinвЂ™s unsuccessful attempt implement nuclear weapons program 1990 shows one mistake leads failure . Iraq received highly enriched uranium research reactor amount almost enough build nuclear bomb . However , person responsible casting , due fear spilling contaminating uranium , decided mix materials small quantities . As result , uranium still lost material obtained enough create nuclear bomb . Albright notes : `` theoretically , possible make bomb , good organizers needed carry whole process , errors possible . '' A way `` borrow half-finished product . '' There , however , another way manufacturing nuclear weapons : produced weapons-grade uranium plutonium acquired another country . In case , number fissile materials required charge small . In 2002 , UN proposed adopt baseline following quantities fissile components nuclear weapons : uranium-233 - one kilogram , uranium-235 - three kilograms plutonium - one kilogram . This amount carried ordinary suitcase . So , task manufacturing nuclear weapon greatly simplified . The time manufacture also reduced . Pentagon experts call dates : uranium plutonium degree enrichment less 20 % , required period year . If highly enriched plutonium uranium metallic form used , production time nuclear weapon 7-10 days . Also
